// -it flag
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48368411/what-is-docker-run-it-flag

-it is short for --interactive + --tty. When you docker run with this command it takes you straight inside the container.
-d is short for --detach, which means you just run the container and then detach from it. Essentially, you run container in the background.
Edit: So if you run the Docker container with -itd, it runs both the -it options and detaches you from the container. As a result, your container will still be running in the background even without any default app to run.
